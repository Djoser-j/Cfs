# continued-fraction-math-library  
  
Cfr is a FreeBASIC library for computing with continued fractions.  
Unpack to the base directory of your FreeBasic installation.  
  
The Cf length (thus the maximum precision) is fixed at compile time,  
also the number of mpz state registers (a b c d) / (e f g h).  
Both are set in include file modules\cfr_lib.bi
